# SURAKSHIT

## Problem
2 of the major problems in the crime sector is providing security and assurance to the victims who are forced to take down crime records when a powerful or influential person is involved on the other side, and if they don't agree to it, they even go to an extent of destroying those records.
The second is measures to prevent crime. Though there are a lot of CCTV cameras deployed across the country, they are majorly used to identify evidences after a crime has occurred, rather than using them to prevent the crime in the first place. Also, the lack of sufficient police forces leads to all regions not being secure.
We'd like to implement an application which uses technology to address all these issues.

Blockchain Smart Contracts can be used to decentralize and secure crime records, such that victims may not be pressurized to take the cases down, as it frequently happens in sensitive cases such as rape. Statistics show that crime usually happens in regions with very less activity, therefore by developing a model which can detect activity in a regions(for example, count the number of vehicles and people) and also regions with extreme and emergency situations such as fighting, mob rage etc., and send notifications about regions with such activity, police patrolling can be done in those regions. Hence this will not only be beneficial in preventing crimes, but also effectively allocate police forces on their patrolling duty.
